# odin-recipes
This is a repo for learning "The Odin Project" course.
I am revising HTML, CSS, JavaScripts. Next, I will choose a path to continue with it. This will help me sharpening my front-end skills and to start calling myself a front-end developer.
I aim to bw a front-end developer. I will update this readme file after completeing the whole course soon!
